This was my final project for the Microsoft Systems and Software Academy. The project goal was to use the MVC design pattern to create a web application that performed CRUD operations. While using a basic structure would have sufficed, I decided that it was a good opportunity to dip my toes in React, as well as create a RESTful API.
